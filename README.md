This image demonstrates the gesture recognition interface, which detects and understands hand
movements. Children can control the app through natural gestures instead of using a mouse or
keyboard. This makes learning more interactive and engaging for preschoolers. It also helps
improve motor skills and encourages active participation.

Step-by-step access:
1. After login, point your hand in front of the camera.
2. The system will detect your hand position and gestures using Leap Motion/Kinect.
3. Move your hand left/right/up/down to navigate and select options.
This makes the app touch-free and enjoyable for kids to use.
